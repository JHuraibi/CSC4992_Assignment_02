For branch [ DictionaryFeasibility/wip ]:

Using a Dictionary and storing its keys in a List does seem doable at this point.
However, categorizing as "feasibility" may be a stretch. The low complexity of the assignment
does not really warrant using such a relatively-complex solution. Nonetheless,
I'm continuing since I find this solution much more interesting.
