Notes

For branch [ DictionaryFeasibility/wip ]:

Using a Dictionary and storing its keys in a List does seem doable at this point.
However, categorizing as "feasibility" may be a stretch. The low complexity of the assignment
does not really warrant using such a relatively-complex solution. Nonetheless,
I'm continuing since I find this solution much more interesting.

Update [20:02 Jun 8]
I've since changed tactics due to time. I'm going with Python's sorted() built-in function 
to sort a multi-dimensional list that will contain each student's information.
Will return in future to revisit storing generated keys in a list to a dictionary. Not sure whether
I will use my method of appending the student ID to their GPA (e.g. 8434.153 for ID 153 w/ GPA of 84.34) or 
just hash the info.

This is very informal...
